<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I’ve tried many fat‑loss and energy boosters, but Liothyronine T3 0.05 mg 60 caps from Swisschems stands out. This T3 thyroid hormone supplement claims to speed up metabolism and boost energy. After testing it for four weeks, I saw real changes in my body fat and workout stamina.

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<p>I ordered directly from Swisschems and received my 60 capsules in five days. I tested the product in three phases:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Phase 1 – Baseline:</strong> One week without T3 to record my normal energy, weight, and mood.</li>
  <li><strong>Phase 2 – Low Dose:</strong> Two weeks at 25 mcg per day (half a capsule). I tracked my resting heart rate, body weight, and focus.</li>
  <li><strong>Phase 3 – Moderate Dose:</strong> Two weeks at 50 mcg per day (one full capsule). I logged workout performance, appetite, and sleep quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>I ranked Liothyronine T3 against three criteria: metabolic boost, energy stability, and side‑effect profile. It scored highest in metabolic boost and clean energy, with mild side effects for me.</p>

<h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
<p>In the low‑dose phase, I felt a gentle rise in body temperature and a slight increase in energy. My workouts felt easier—even my morning jog felt less taxing. By week four, during the moderate‑dose phase, I noticed a drop of 3 lbs of stubborn fat without changing my diet. I also had more focus at work and a stable mood throughout the day.</p>
<p>I did experience a slight increase in heart rate (around 5 bpm) and minor jitters if I skipped meals. These were easy to manage by eating small snacks and lowering the dose on rest days.</p>

<h2>Key Benefits</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Metabolic Boost:</strong> Speeds up calorie burn by raising metabolic rate.</li>
  <li><strong>Energy Levels:</strong> Provides sustained energy without crash.</li>
  <li><strong>Fat Loss:</strong> Helps target stubborn body fat in problem areas.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus & Mood:</strong> Enhances mental clarity and steady mood.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dosage and Usage</h2>
<p>Swisschems capsules contain 0.05 mg (50 mcg) of Liothyronine T3 each. I recommend beginners start at 25 mcg per day (open capsule and split powder). After one week, assess tolerance and increase to 50 mcg if needed. Always take on an empty stomach, 30 minutes before breakfast, for best absorption.</p>
<p>Never exceed 100 mcg per day without medical supervision. If you feel jittery or anxious, reduce dose or skip a day. Cycle for 4–6 weeks, then take a 2‑week break to reset your thyroid axis.</p>
